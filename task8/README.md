# Client-server App

>This program emulates server - client relationship  

The way to build this project is pretty wierd. To build client simply use 

```terminal 
  gcc client.c -o clt
```
In order to build all the servers you should change PORT[i] in server.c and make binary srv[i] 

Then  you'll recieve 4 srv's and clt binary files, all servers and client.

To use you should obviously run all srvs and than clt

Server can manage 64 clients.

After clt is launched you may ask servers to calculate integral of function y = x

```
  calculate
   #some response

  <right>
  recieved integral
```


**Have fun!**
