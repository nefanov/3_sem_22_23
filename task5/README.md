The program is created for transmitting the data from terminal to output file, using signals for synchorinzation. 

# How to build

```terminal        
  $ gcc task5.c -lrt
  $ ./a.out
  ```
  
  After launching program from terminal via ./a.out you'll have to input something via your keyboard.
  
  To stop the program use sigint
   
  Eventually you'll recieve all the data in out.txt and get the logs in the log.txt.

**Have fun!**
