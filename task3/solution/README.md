## IPC Analysis

### Tests were carried out with these parameters

| File size |        |      |
|-----------|--------|------|
| small     | medium | big  |
| 1 KB      | 1 MB   | 1 GB |

| Buffer size |        |      |
|-----------|--------|------|
| small     | medium | big  |
| 1 KB      | 1 MB   | 1 GB |

### CONCLUSION:

The fastest IPC turned out to be __shared memory__. But this is not surprising, since this IPC simply creates a common area in RAM without any add-ons of other IPCs.
Next comes the __FIFO__ performance. It is also due to the simplicity of implementation.
__MSQ__ turned out to be the slowest.
